#Hacking On The Manifesto

###Background

The manifesto acts as a sort of code of conduct for developers down with the Namespace App Club movement. While we won't
execute you if you don't follow it, (we probably won't execute your code then) we will all probably enjoy software
development more if everyone did.

The manifesto is stored in the `MANIFESTO.md` file. Put anything in there that you think developers should keep in mind
in there daily adventures in order for us to have a clean, healthy and productive software development industry.

###Is that it?

Not quite; see we encourage collaboration around these parts. [Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
are a great way to let others see and discuss your proposed changes to the manifesto before they are commited.

Create a `PR` with your change and give some for others to review it. Other contributors should coment with a '+1' to
indicate that they are ok with the change. Once no one indicates a problem it will be merged.

###What if no one replies?

:fearful: Then it should be merged without question eventually. 

"He that hold issue and resolve to silence shall be deemed moot"

###Ok I'm ready to do this

Excellent! Sign off the AUTHORS.md file when you are done!
